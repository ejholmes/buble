# [Buble](https://github.com/ejholmes/buble)

Buble is a Go library and a set of best practices for building JSON api's.
Buble is not a framework, and it doesn't have a router. It just provides
a small layer of abstraction over the stdlib's http package for building
handlers.

Buble is inspired by [grape](https://github.com/intridea/grape)
